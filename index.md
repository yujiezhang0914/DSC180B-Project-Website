## Introduction

- We plan to introduce our project's goals, why it's important and how we planned to do it.

## Datasets

- We plan to describe the datasets we used in our project.

### Health Care

Briefly explain the feature of the dataset, feature engineering steps, and the prediction task. Include link to the original dataset.

### Loan

Briefly explain the feature of the dataset, feature engineering steps, and the prediction task. Include link to the original dataset.

### Housing

Briefly explain the feature of the dataset, feature engineering steps, and the prediction task. Include link to the original dataset.

## Method

We selected four popular machine learning models that's often used in tabular data classification. Our model selection covers classic machine learning model, ensemble model, and deep learning model. Following is a breif introduction to those models. Since this project focuses on model explanation, we will skip the model training details here.

* SVM: Support vector machine is a supervise learning method effective in high dimensional spaces. It project datapoints to high dimensional space and seperate them with a hyperplane.
* LGBM: LightGBM is an ensemble model with gradient boosted decision trees.
* XGBoost: Similar as LGBM, extreme Gradient Boosting is an implementation of gradient boosted decision trees with more regularized parallel decision trees.
* TabNet: TabNet is an deep tabular data learning architecture based on attentive transformer.
